# NAND2Tetris

Programming assignments from: 
The Elements of Computing Systems: 
Building a Modern Computer from First Principles 
as part of the online Coursera course.

The first five projects were completed in an HDL.

I originally wrote the sixth project in Python as I was focused on learning it 
at the time I took part one of the online course. On 10/19/2021 I completed the
project in C++. I am currently focused on improving my knowledge and experience
with modern C++ as that is the primary language I will be using in my new
position I just started four months ago.

I'm considering completing all the projects in other languages upon completion 
of part two of the course. Languages I'm considering are JavaScript, Python, 
and Rust. JavaScript is becoming more of a favorite as I practice using it more
and more and continue to learn React. Rust is especially interesting to me as I
started learning it a few years a go, but had to put in on the shelf to
contrate on other things. Once I feel more confident using modern C++, I want
to continue learning and practicing using Rust. I hope we eventually do a
project at work using Rust.
